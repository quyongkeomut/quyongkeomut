I have finished my Banchelor Degree of Software Engineering at School of Business Information Technology, University of Economics of Ho Chi Minh city.
My research of interest are: Computer Vision, Vision Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning frameworks. Besides these, currently I am fond of 
Graph Neural Nets and AGI.

âš¡ Fun fact about me:
1. I was a student of Phan ChÃ¢u Trinh highschool in Da Nang city, Viet Nam.
2. I have learnt programming when I was in grade 8, the programming languages spans in this order: Pascal, C++, C#, Python
3. I have not been taught Deep Learning and other âœ¨ deeper âœ¨ stuffs about machine learning at my uni, or at research labs (because I didn't join any ðŸ˜„). I learnt all by myself from second year (it has been 1 year and a half 'til now) 
4. My current work is about Vision Transformer on Segmentation. This research is still being done (with my friend and my mentor), and I will update the repository along with the preprint paper as soon as possible.
5. I really want to pursue a serious research career in Deep Learning.
