I have finished my Banchelor Degree of Software Engineering at School of Business Information Technology, University of Economics of Ho Chi Minh city.
My research of interest are: Computer Vision, Vision Generative Models and Self-supervised Learning frameworks. Besides these, currently I am fond of 
Graph Neural Nets and AGI.
